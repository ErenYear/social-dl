# Light weight Instagram DL bot.

# Deploy:

 * Config:
   * Get API_ID and API_HASH from https://my.telegram.org/auth .
   * Generate String Session by running this in termux: 
     ```bash 
     bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ux-termux/string/main/Termux.sh)" 
     ```
     * It will ask you to choose pyrogram version. Select 2.

   * <details> 
     <summary> Message_link : </summary>

     * Create a private channel on TG.
     * Send a list of Chat/Channel ids starting with -100 in your log channel like below.  
       <p align="right"><img src="https://telegra.ph/file/394daa80fd53c895cbe6e.jpg"</p>
     * Bot will automatically download links in those chats/channels.
     * Now copy that message's link and you will get something like  
       https://t.me/c/123456789/1
     * So your value would be -100123456789/1
     </details>

   * User : Your user id to control bot.
   * Trigger : Trigger to access bot.

    ```

    # Start bot

    ```

 * If everything is correct you will get <b><i>Started</i></b> stdout in terminal and in your channel.

# Usage and Commands:
 * Send Instagram link in any authorised chat/channel, bot will try to download and send the media.  
 * Owner only commands:
   * `.dl link` to download and send media in any chat.
   * `.update` to refresh chat list without restarting bot.
   * `.restart` to restart bot.
   * These commands can be used anywhere and are not limited to authorised chats.

# Known limitations:
 * If deployed on a VPS or any server Instragram might block access to some content.  
 After hitting Instagram's rate limit image download might not work because servers and vps usually have static IP and Instagram would block access.
 * Deploying it locally would solve all of those issues since most of us have dynamic IP and Instagram will not be able to block access.  
 Bot is made lightweight with local deploys in mind. But battery life will take some hit anyway.
 * Logging in with your Instagram which would solve the rate-limit issues is not added and won't be added because 2 of my accounts were suspended till manual verification for using scrapping bots like these with login.
